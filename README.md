## Dicee Challenge

## Overview
This is a simple web application that simulates a two-player dice game. The page generates random dice images for each player, compares the results, and declares the winner or a draw.

## How It Works
Two random numbers between 1 and 6 are generated to simulate the roll of two dice.
Corresponding dice images are displayed based on the generated numbers.
The page announces the winner or declares a draw based on the comparison of the two numbers.

## Usage
